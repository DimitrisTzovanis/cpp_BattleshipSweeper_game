# BattleshipSweeper game

## Members: Dimitris Tzovanis, Elpida Stasinou

This game coded in c++ is a hybrid of the two known games: battleship and Minesweeper.

### This project uses the sgg graphics library

- Below tiles that cover the entire board there are hidden ships and mines. You have to click on tiles to remove them to uncover the ships while avoiding the mines.
- Around mines there are numbers (just like Minesweeper) that display the number of mines are them to help the player avoid them.
- the ships are split into parts the same way they are in Battleship)
- Find all ships while avoiding the mines to win.
